## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I'm hoping to find a correlation between physiological markers like age, number of pregnancies, and BMI that could predict early-onset diabetes. Diabetes is a very underrated disease that doesn't nearly get the publicity that other diseases like HIV, Breast Cancer, and MS. Diabetes is a lifelong struggle once it is diagnosed which involves watching diet and blood glucose to prevent insulin shock which could result in death. Another nasty side effect is the loss of limb due to diabetes or more commonly extremities like fingers. Early diagnosis prediabetes, a risk factor of diabetes it self, can be managed to have a minimal impact on livelihood and even eventualy reversed<sup>1</sup>. There are a few physiological risk factors for prediabetes such as: being overweight, age 45yr or older and doesn't excersice often<sup>1</sup>. I want to explore the possibility of correlations in the data set that could lead to a machine learning algorithm in a future study. This data could be used to develop machine learning technology that could help doctors detect and diagnose diabetes earlier than ever before.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease collected data on patients and formed a data set including multiple physiological data markers. This specific data set includes only females above the age of 21 in India. It records their age, BMI, Insulin, Skinfold measurement, Blood Pressure, Glucose, Number of pregnancies, Diabetes pedigree, and a final outcome variable that indicates whether they do or do not have diabetes. This data was collected as part of another data set in India during a larger study and its purpose is to train an algorithm to predict the diagnosis of diabetes in patients from a set of physiological data points. The data was most likely collected from patient records across India to give a large and diverse sample form the algorithm to be based on. This collection of data can now also be used to form correlations between different physiological measurements and the diagnosis of diabetes.
